Over the past couple of weeks, I have been trying to get my computer to work.  I bought a new NVME SSD for a future computer build, I thought it would be a good idea to use it first, installing any software and saving files I might use on my new computer before I build it.  That sounded like a good idea, right?  Unfortunately, it turned into a bit of a nightmare.  Windows installers would not install on the new drive, rendering the 1TB terabyte drive useless without an enclosure.  This was frustrating, but represented a great opportunity to try linux again.  I installed Arch linux and the SSD was usable again.  

I found it fun to tinker with Linux, customizing every little bit to make your perfect operating system.  This reperesnts a major problem.  I found myself spending so much time tinkering with the terminal, puting the right icons on the dock, making the tiling windows manager work perfectly that it was all I did.  I stopped doing what I'm building a computer for in the first place:  Dabbling in software engineering, learning blender and game design (amongst some other hobbies, my head is in the clouds, I know.)  In the end, I figured out what was wrong with my computer and reinstalled windows.

Windows sucks.  You can't customize anything and they hold your hand like a nanny, but at least I am far less distracted with the opportunity to tinker with every little thing.

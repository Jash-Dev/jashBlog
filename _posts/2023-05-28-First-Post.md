It's been a long road, and throughout most of that road, I've had a computer in some way, shape or form, even if it was just a smart phone.   I grew up deeply interested in computers, game design and coding, but never had the will to pursue these things.  The universe has a way of directing you sometimes.  2 years ago, I was given the opportunity to work as a computer science teacher, which forced me to learn how to code and about computers.  In the end, I learned javaScript, Python, C# and relearned HTML for the sake of my job.  I enjoyed it quite a bit and wish to continue learning, even though I am now a special education teacher.  This blog will be a means of tracking my progress and giving my opinion on various things technology and beyond.  As of now, I will try to update weekly.
